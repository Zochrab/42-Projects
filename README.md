# 42Berlin Projects

This repository contains all the projects I've completed or am working on as part of my studies at **42Berlin**. The projects cover various topics in C programming, data structures, algorithms, and more, and follow the guidelines and constraints set by the 42 curriculum.

## Disclaimer

This is first and foremost a personal archive. I give no guarantees that any of the Projects here work when installed, don't forget the Subject files can change and the whims and thoroughness of your evaluators play an even bigger role, be vigilant and try to code stuff on your own. Good luck.
